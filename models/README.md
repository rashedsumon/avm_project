# Automated Valuation Model (AVM)

## Overview
This project implements an Automated Valuation Model (AVM) for predicting fair property prices based on features such as location, area, rooms, year built, and renovation level. The model uses machine learning algorithms like XGBoost to train on a dataset of real estate listings and predict prices for new listings.

## Features
- Input property features: location, area, rooms, year built, renovation level
- Predict the price of a property based on user input
- Trained on a dataset of real estate listings

## Requirements
- Python 3.11.0
- Streamlit for the web app
- XGBoost for the regression model
